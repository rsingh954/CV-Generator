# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `What I learned:`

I learned that useContext is a better way to handle state
With passing props I feel like there is unnecessary effort with abstracting until you get a single source of truth if that makes sense.

I usually use the useContext api with reducers but I decided to try and make something without it.
